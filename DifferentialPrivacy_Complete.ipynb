    "# Differential Privacy: Protecting Individual Privacy in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement **differential privacy** to protect sensitive personal information while maintaining the utility of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Differential Privacy?\n",
    "Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that adds controlled \"noise\" to data, making it impossible to identify specific individuals while preserving overall statistical patterns. Think of it like pixelating faces in a photo - individuals become unrecognizable, but you can still see the general scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Do:\n",
    "1. **Load and prepare data** - Using the Adult Income dataset (census data)\n",
    "2. **Apply differential privacy** - Add noise to sensitive attributes (age and sex)\n",
    "3. **Analyze the impact** - Measure how much error the privacy adds\n",
    "4. **Train classifiers** - Compare ML models on original vs. private data\n",
    "5. **Evaluate trade-offs** - Find the optimal balance between privacy and accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concept: Epsilon (ε)\n",
    "Epsilon controls the privacy-utility trade-off:\n",
    "- **Small ε (0.1-0.5)**: More privacy, more noise, less accurate\n",
    "- **Medium ε (1.0-2.0)**: Balanced privacy and utility\n",
    "- **Large ε (5.0+)**: Less privacy, less noise, more accurate"
